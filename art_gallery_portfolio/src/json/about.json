    },
    {
        "question": "When did you start making art?",
        "answer": "Since middle school. Started when i first drew my best friend at the time as a south park character on my notebook. Then, I asked my mom soon after if I could get a sketchbook and thats where i really began to draw a lot. I would draw mario bros characters and mortal kombat stuff. Around the beginning of 8th grade, I realized if i tried hard enough (and used rulers properly), i could get into an art school. In the middle of that year when we had to search for high schools, I was reading a book of public schools and I came across Art and Design High School of Manhattan. Seemed pretty cool so I haphazardly put together a portfolio and thankfully, I somehow got in. I majored in Animation and gradually refined my craft (still bad but not as bad as it used to be.)."

    {
        "question": "So you went to do art at first but now you're a programmer. How come?",
        "answer": "After completing many animation assignments at A&D, I realized that I only enjoyed art if I felt like doing it. Gradually, the prospect of having to work long hours to draw so many frames for projects that I won't care too much about became less exciting. I decided instead to find something else to do that I can pursue as a career and also find enjoyment in. I pursued programming because stuff like web development and software development still allows me to express my creative side. I'm not giving up on art but rather I am changing my trajectory to something else that can help me do what I love comfortably."

    {
        "question": "Thats...a lot of goth art. Whats up with that?",
        "answer": "Luv me Goth rock. Simple as..."
    },
    {
        "question": "How often do you post?",
        "answer": " I don't have a schedule for when I post art. I just do it whenever I can and want. I can post something tomorrow or five years from now Life gets in the way all the time so this website is probably not going to be updated too often but more will come."
    },
    {
        "question": "Any future plans?",
        "answer": "I am currently working on a backend to add user auth and admin dashboard for myself. Stay tuned for more."
