# Art Gallery
Welcome to my art gallery! This is my website where I have all of my art viewable in an official site. Since middle school, I began pursuing art as a future endeavor and after completing middle school, I enrolled into Art and Design High School of Manhattan.

While majoring as an animator, I gained a lot of experience and learned from my mistakes with guidance from my teachers. As much as I enjoyed studying at A&D, I realized around senior year that I preferred to do art as a hobby. Since then, I did not attend art school in favor of a degree in Computer Science.

Since I began studying at St. John's University in Computer Science, I learned to use many technologies, including web development technologies. Software/Web development is something I love to pursue because like Art, it allows me to open up my creative side. 

In this project, I bring both my art and programming skills to develop an art gallery where I present all of my artworks.
